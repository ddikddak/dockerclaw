# Bug ID: BUG-001

## Title
Card action buttons (approve/reject/delete/archive) are non-functional - handlers not wired up

## Status
- [x] Open
- [x] In Progress
- [x] Fixed
- [x] Verified
- [ ] Closed

## Severity
- [x] High - Major feature broken, workaround difficult

## Description
The Card component defines action buttons (Approve, Reject, Delete, Archive) in the UI, but these buttons are never shown because the action handler props (`onApprove`, `onReject`, `onDelete`, `onArchive`) are not passed from the parent components.

In `Card.tsx`, the action buttons are conditionally rendered:
```tsx
<AnimatePresence>
  {(isHovered || isProcessing) && (onApprove || onReject || onDelete || onArchive) && (
    // buttons here
  )}
</AnimatePresence>
```

Since none of these handlers are passed from `Column.tsx` or `Board.tsx`, the condition `(onApprove || onReject || onDelete || onArchive)` is always falsy, and the buttons never appear.

Additionally, the inline editing handlers (`onEditText`, `onToggleCheck`) are also not passed, making text editing and checkbox toggling non-functional.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start the frontend dev server
2. Navigate to the board page
3. Hover over any card
4. Observe that no action buttons appear
5. Try to double-click text to edit - nothing happens
6. Try to toggle checkboxes - nothing happens

## Expected Behavior
- Hovering over a card should show Approve, Reject, Delete, Archive buttons
- Double-clicking text content should enter edit mode
- Clicking checkboxes should toggle their state

## Actual Behavior
- No action buttons appear on hover
- Double-clicking text does nothing
- Checkboxes cannot be toggled

## Root Cause
The component hierarchy fails to pass handler props:
- `Board.tsx` renders `Column` without action handlers
- `Column.tsx` renders `Card` without action handlers
- Handlers need to be defined and passed through the component tree

## Proposed Fix
1. Define action handler functions in `Board.tsx` that call the API
2. Pass these handlers through `Column` to `Card`
3. Example handlers needed:
   - `handleApprove(id)` → calls `api.approveCard(id)`
   - `handleReject(id)` → calls `api.rejectCard(id)`
   - `handleDelete(id)` → calls `api.deleteCard(id)`
   - `handleArchive(id)` → calls `api.archiveCard(id)`
   - `handleEditText(id, componentId, text)` → calls `api.editText(...)`
   - `handleToggleCheck(...)` → calls `api.toggleCheck(...)`

## Files Affected
- `frontend/src/components/Board.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Column.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Card.tsx` (already accepts props, just needs them passed)

## Environment
- Browser: Any
- Version: Phase 03
- OS: Any

## Additional Notes
The DndProvider has its own `handleDragEnd` that handles card moves correctly, but other actions are not implemented.
